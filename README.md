# past-projects
Some past projects, I worked with using a web framework to display results.

These are just saved versions of projects, I worked on outside of school while pursuing my undergraduate.

I don't care to look up solutions. It ruins the experience. Failure is an integral part of learning. 

To learn more about transforming my thoughts into code is beautiful.
